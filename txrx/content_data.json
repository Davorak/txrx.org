You can become a member by coming to one of our Open House Fridays and telling one of our officers or directors that you want to be a member.  The membership fee gets you access to tools, collective wisdom, and a racous list-serve!  We have been known to stay late and turn the volume to eleven.  We look forward to welcoming you to Tx/Rx Labs.  Why TX/RX Labs?  Imagine how much innovation could occur if the creative community in Houston had access to the tools and knowledge needed to bring its ideas to fruition.  We believe that we must revive the tradition of design and manufacturing in America after decades of neglect and decline.  Many of America\u2019s greatest industries began in inspired moments in garage workshops.  We hope to provide you with that workshop through our classes and other educational programs, collective wisdom, and lab space.  How to Help  Become a member.  Our greatest resource is the diversity and creativity of our members, and we are always open to new perspectives and disciplines. Volunteer!  We need people to help spread the word about what we are trying to do.  Email us at txrxlabs@googlegroups.com or visit us on Open House Fridays and we will find a way for you to help. Make a cash donation. Donate tools, computers, electronics.  Have a tool you don\u2019t use that often?  We can use it!
